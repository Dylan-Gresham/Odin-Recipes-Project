# Odin-Recipes-Project
This project is from The Odin Project and is meant to serve as a simple website that will have a main page that has links to subpages with recipes on them. This project will be revisited in the future to be improved upon once CSS is learned.

### What This Shows

This project will allow me to show that I can actually use links and images to properly create a website that isn't just a single long page but instead can be broken apart into smaller individual pages each with their own purpose.
