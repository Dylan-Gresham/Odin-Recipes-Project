    <h4> Description </h4>
    <p> Jalapeno Poppers are a perfect snack for get togethers and parties. They're easy to make and delicious with their 
        cream cheese filling and bacon wrapping while still having a small but tasteful kick from the jalapenos.
    </p>
    <h4> Ingredients (1 batch) </h4>
    <ul>
        <li> 12 medium sized Jalapenos (no longer than 3 inches each, about 2/3 pounds total) </li>
        <li> 8 ounces (oz.) Cream Cheese, softened </li>
        <li> Scant 1/4 cup finely chopped Cilantro </li>
        <li> 3 Scallions, whites and greens parts, trimmed and very thinly sliced (about 1/4 cup) </li>
        <li> 1 Garlic Clove, finely chopped </li>
        <li> 1 Lime, zested (about 1/2 teaspoon), optional </li>
        <li> Kosher Salt and Black Pepper, to taste </li>
        <li> 12 thin slices of uncooked Bacon (thick-cut bacon won't cook as evenly), halved crosswise </li>
    </ul>
    <h4> Steps </h4>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil, then top with a wire rack. </li>
        <li> Halve jalapenos lengthwise (do your best to halve them through their stems for added visual appeal). Using the tip
             of a small spoon, scoop out and discard the seeds. Set the halved jalapenos aside. </li>
        <li> In a medium sized bowl, stir together the cream cheese, cilantro, scallions, garlic, and lime zet (if using); season
             generously with salt and pepper. </li>
        <li> Season the inside of each halved jalapeno with salt and pepper, then fill each with about 2 teaspoons of the cream
             cheese mixture (fill until there's a slight dome on top). Wrap each stuffed jalapeno with 1 piece of bacon, setting one
             tip of bacon on top of the cream cheese filling, then wrapping the bacon under and over the popper at an angle, so 
             the bacon covers the filling on top in two layers (the bacon will shrink as it cooks, so you want to make sure the 
             top of the popper is well covered). Arrange poppers evenly on the wire rack, nestling each popper between two parallel wires
             to keep it upright so the cream cheese doesn't spill during baking. </li>
        <li> Transfer to the oven, and bake until bacon is cooked through, about 25 minutes. Broil on the rack closest to the broiler
             until crisp, about 2 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes, then serve warm. </li>
        <li> Finally, enjoy! </li>
    </ol>
