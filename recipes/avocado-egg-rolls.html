    <h4 class="headers"> Description </h4>
    <p> Avocado Egg Rolls are a delicious snack that can be made in a short amount of time, typically under an hour!
        These rolls consist of a fried, crispy exterior with a smoothy, flavor packed avocado mixture on the inside. </p>

        <li class="list"> <div class="list-text"> 3 tablespoons Cilantro leaves (chopped) </div></li>
        <li class="list"> <div class="list-text"> 1/4 teaspoon Salt </div></li>
        <li class="list"> <div class="list-text"> 1 Lime worth of juice </div></li>
        <li class="list"> <div class="list-text"> 1/2 of a Lemon's juice </div></li>
        <li class="list"> <div class="list-text"> Vegetable oil for frying, the amount needed will vary depending on your pot size </div></li>
        <li class="list"> <div class="list-text"> 8-12 Wonton wrappers </div></li>
        <li class="list"> <div class="list-text"> 1 egg (if doing more than one serving still use one egg and just add water to it) </div></li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="headers"> Steps </h4>
    <ol>
        <li class="list"> <div class="list-text"> Begin by chopping up your avocados, red onion, sun dried tomatoes, and cilantro if not done already. </div></li>
        <li class="list"> <div class="list-text"> Next add all of your chopped ingredients to a mixing bowl and mix until everything is incorporated and your avocado 
             is no longer chunky. </div></li>
        <li class="list"> <div class="list-text"> Once everything is mixed together, add in your lime juice and mix around a bit more. </div></li>
        <li class="list"> <div class="list-text"> Prepare egg mix by cracking your 1 egg into a small bowl and adding a bit of water then mix it together until the 
             yolk and whites are mixed together. </div></li>
        <li class="list"> <div class="list-text"> Now, get a cutting board and place a wonton wrapper on it. </div></li>
        <li class="list"> <div class="list-text"> Using your finger or a sauce brush, coat all four edges of the wonton wrapper with the egg wash. Make sure to get 
             about 1/8th of an inch of each edge covered by the egg wash mixture so it can properly stick once folded up. </div></li>
        <li class="list"> <div class="list-text"> Using a spoon or your mixing utensil, place some of your mixture on to the center of the wrapper in a line with each
             end of the line pointing to a corner. </div></li>
        <li class="list"> <div class="list-text"> Fold the wrapper like a burrito by folding one of the corners that the line of mixture isn't pointing towards over 
             the mixture, tucking the sides in, and then rolling up into a cylindrical shape. </div></li>
        <li class="list"> <div class="list-text"> Set aside on a pan, plate, or wire rack until you're ready to fry. </div></li>
        <li class="list"> <div class="list-text"> Repeat steps 5-9 until you're out of the avocado mixture or wonton wrappers. </div></li>
        <li class="list"> <div class="list-text"> Once all your egg rolls are ready to be fried, add enough vegetable oil to a pot to where an egg roll could completely 
             submerge in the oil without touching the bottom of the pot. </div></li>
        <li class="list"> <div class="list-text"> Turn your stove on to High and wait for your oil to heat up. </div></li>
        <li class="list"> <div class="list-text"> Add in as many egg rolls to the oil as you can without having the egg rolls touch each other. They should fry for 
             about 2-3 minutes or until the outside of the wrapper is a nice golden brown color. </div></li>
        <li class="list"> <div class="list-text"> Remove egg rolls from the oil once they're done frying and place onto either a wire rack with paper towels or a pan 
             underneath to catch the oil that falls off or place directly on to paper towels. </div></li>
        <li class="list"> <div class="list-text"> Repeat Steps 13 and 14 until all egg rolls are done frying. </div></li>
        <li class="list"> <div class="list-text"> Optionally, cut each egg roll diagonally down the middle to plate and serve. </div></li>
        <li class="list"> <div class="list-text"> Finally, enjoy! </div></li>
    </ol>
