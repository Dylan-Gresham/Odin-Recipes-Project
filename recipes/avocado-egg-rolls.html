    <h4> Description </h4>
    <p> Avocado Egg Rolls are a delicious snack that can be made in a short amount of time, typically under an hour!
        These rolls consist of a fried, crispy exterior with a smoothy, flavor packed avocado mixture on the inside. </p>
    <h4> Ingredients (1 serving) </h4>
    <ul>
        <li> 3 Avocados (diced) </li>
        <li> 1/4 cup Red Onion (diced) </li>
        <li> 8 tablespoons Sun Dried Tomato (cut into small pieces) </li>
        <li> 3 tablespoons Cilantro leaves (chopped) </li>
        <li> 1/4 teaspoon Salt </li>
        <li> 1 Lime worth of juice </li>
        <li> 1/2 of a Lemon's juice </li>
        <li> Vegetable oil for frying, the amount needed will vary depending on your pot size </li>
        <li> 8-12 Wonton wrappers </li>
        <li> 1 egg (if doing more than one serving still use one egg and just add water to it) </li>
    </ul>
    <h4> Steps </h4>
    <ol>
        <li> Begin by chopping up your avocados, red onion, sun dried tomatoes, and cilantro if not done already. </li>
        <li> Next add all of your chopped ingredients to a mixing bowl and mix until everything is incorporated and your avocado is no longer chunky. </li>
        <li> Once everything is mixed together, add in your lime juice and mix around a bit more. </li>
        <li> Prepare egg mix by cracking your 1 egg into a small bowl and adding a bit of water then mix it together until the yolk and whites are mixed together. </li>
        <li> Now, get a cutting board and place a wonton wrapper on it. </li>
        <li> Using your finger or a sauce brush, coat all four edges of the wonton wrapper with the egg wash. Make sure to get about 1/8th of an inch of each edge covered by the egg wash mixture so it can properly stick once folded up. </li>
        <li> Using a spoon or your mixing utensil, place some of your mixture on to the center of the wrapper in a line with each end of the line pointing to a corner. </li>
        <li> Fold the wrapper like a burrito by folding one of the corners that the line of mixture isn't pointing towards over the mixture, tucking the sides in, and then rolling up into a cylindrical shape. </li>
        <li> Set aside on a pan, plate, or wire rack until you're ready to fry. </li>
        <li> Repeat steps 5-9 until you're out of the avocado mixture or wonton wrappers. </li>
        <li> Once all your egg rolls are ready to be fried, add enough vegetable oil to a pot to where an egg roll could completely submerge in the oil without touching the bottom of the pot. </li>
        <li> Turn your stove on to High and wait for your oil to heat up. </li>
        <li> Add in as many egg rolls to the oil as you can without having the egg rolls touch each other. They should fry for about 2-3 minutes or until the outside of the wrapper is a nice golden brown color. </li>
        <li> Remove egg rolls from the oil once they're done frying and place onto either a wire rack with paper towels or a pan underneath to catch the oil that falls off or place directly on to paper towels. </li>
        <li> Repeat Steps 13 and 14 until all egg rolls are done frying. </li>
        <li> Optionally, cut each egg roll diagonally down the middle to plate and serve. </li>
        <li> Finally, enjoy! </li>
    </ol>
